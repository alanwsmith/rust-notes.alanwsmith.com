# Introduction

One of the ways I learn is by doing write-ups of
whatever I'm working on. Right now, that's rust.
I'm putting this site together to collect them.
You may find them helpful if you learn the way
I do.

Most pages have examples on them where I show
a full set of source code then show how to
put it together step-by-step. Here's an example
with "Hello World"

<div id="source" />

This is a test note for putting content 
after the source blocks

### Full Source Code
```rust
```
### Add the `main` function
```rust
```
