# TODO

- <strike>Add styling around examples</strike>
- <strike>Turn off search since there is no backend</strike>
- Check highlight styles and fades in the different themes
- Turn off Run option for partial examples
- Make run button always visible
- Make run button say Run
- Turn off undo button (feels more noise then useful)
- Prevent top bar from floating back in and covering run buttons
- Add notes section after the examples
