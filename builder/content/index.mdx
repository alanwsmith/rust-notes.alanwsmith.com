Introduction

---> CONTENT

One of the ways I learn is by doing write-ups of
whatever I'm working on. Right now, that's rust.
I'm putting this site together to collect them.
You may find them helpful if you learn the way
I do.

Most pages have examples on them where I show
a full set of source code then show how to
put it together step-by-step. Here's an example
with "Hello World"

This is a test note for putting content 
after the source blocks


---> SOURCE

fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}

---> EXAMPLE 

heading: Full Source Code

visible: [1, 2, 3]

fadeLines: [2,3]

fadeWords:
  - line: 3
    word: 1

overrides:
  - line: 2
    text: "  the quick brown fox"

note: | 
  This is the full source code for 
  `Hello, World`.

  The examples on the site start with the 
  full source code then go through it 
  step by step to show how it works.


---> EXAMPLE 

heading: Add the `main` function 
visible: [1,  3]
fadeLines: [1]
fadeWords: []
overrides: []
note: |
  Each program starts with a `main` function
  which is where Rust first looks when it starts
  things up.
