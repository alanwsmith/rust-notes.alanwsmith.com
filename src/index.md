# Introduction

One of the ways I learn is by doing write-ups of
whatever I'm working on. Right now, that's rust.
I'm putting this site together to collect them.
You may find them helpful if you learn the way
I do.

Most pages have examples on them where I show
a full set of source code then show how to
put it together step-by-step. Here's an example
with "Hello World"

<div class="full_source">

### Full Source Code

```rust, editable
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

<div class="note"></div>

</div>

<h2>Step By Step</h2><div class="example">

### Add the `main` function

```rust, editable
fn main() {

}
```

<div class="note"></div>

</div>

<div class="example">

### Print to the terminal

```rust, editable
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

<div class="note"></div>

</div>

<div class="example">

### Run it

```rust, editable
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

<div class="note">This is the full example again. 
It's editable and you can run
it directly on the site.</div>

</div>
