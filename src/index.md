# Introduction

One of the ways I learn is by doing write-ups of
whatever I'm working on. Right now, that's rust.
I'm putting this site together to collect them.
You may find them helpful if you learn the way
I do.

Most pages have examples on them where I show
a full set of source code then show how to
put it together step-by-step. Here's an example
with "Hello World"

This is a test note for putting content 
after the source blocks

### Full Source Code
```rust, editable
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
}
```

This is the full source code for 
`Hello, World`.

The examples on the site start with the 
full source code then go through it 
step by step to show how it works.

### Add the `main` function
```rust, editable
fn main() {
  the quick brown fox
}
```

Each program starts with a `main` function
which is where Rust first looks when it starts
things up.

 <script>const c = { sets: [ { fadeWords: [{line: 2,words: [1, 2, 3, ]},],fadeLines: [1,]},{ fadeWords: [],fadeLines: [1,]},] }; </script>
