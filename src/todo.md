# TODO

- Check highlight fades in the different themes
- Add styling around examples
- Turn off Run option for partial examples
- Make run button always visible
- Make run button say Run
- Turn off undo button (feels more noise then useful)
- Prevent top bar from floating back in and covering run buttons
- Add notes section after the examples
- Turn off search since there is no backend
