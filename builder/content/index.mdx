One of the ways I learn is by doing write-ups of
whatever I'm working on. Right now, that's rust.
I'm putting this site together to collect them.
You may find them helpful if you learn the way
I do.

Most pages have examples on them where I show
a full set of source code then show how to
put it together step-by-step. Here's an example
with "Hello World"

<div id="source" />

---> SOURCE

fn main() {
println!("Hello, World");
}

lines: [1, 2, 3],
highlights: [1, 2, 3]
heading: "Full Source Code"
note: `This is the full source code for "Hello, World". 

The examples on the site start with the full source code then 
go through it step by step to show how it works.`
},

{
  lines: [1, 3],
  highlights: [1, 3],
  headings: "Create `main`",
  note: `Every example on this site is a full Rust
program.

Each one starts with a `main` function
which is where Rust first looks when it starts
things up.`

}
